            My castle crumbled overnight
            I brought a knife to a gunfight
            They took the crown, but it's alright
            All the liars are calling me one
            Nobody's heard from me for months
            I'm doing better than I ever was
            'Cause my baby's fit like a daydream
            Walkin' with his head down, I'm the one he's walkin' to
            So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to
            My baby's fly like a jet stream
            High above the whole scene, loves me like I'm brand new
            So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to
            All my flowers grew back as thorns
            Windows boarded up after the storm
            He built a fire just to keep me warm
            All the drama queens taking swings
            All the jokers dressin' up as kings
            They fade to nothin' when I look at him
            And I know I make the same mistakes every time
            Bridges burn, I never learn, at least I did one thing right
            I did one thing right
            I'm laughin' with my lover, makin' forts under covers
            Trust him like a brother, yeah, you know I did one thing right
            Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night
            My baby's fit like a daydream
            Walkin' with his head down, I'm the one he's walkin' to
            So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to
            My baby's fly like a jet stream
            High above the whole scene, loves me like I'm brand new
            (Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
            So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to
            I want to wear his initial
            On a chain 'round my neck, chain 'round my neck
            Not because he owns me
            But 'cause he really knows me
            Which is more than they can say, I
            I recall late November
            Holdin' my breath, slowly I said
            "You don't need to save me
            But would you run away with me?"
            Yes (would you run away?)
            My baby's fit like a daydream
            Walkin' with his head down, I'm the one he's walkin' to
            (Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
            So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to
            My baby's fly like a jet stream
            High above the whole scene, loves me like I'm brand new
            (Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
            So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to
            Call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want
            To
            Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind
            Didn't notice you walking all over my peace of mind
            In the shoes I gave you as a present
            Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five
            And by the way, I'm going out tonight
            Best believe I'm still bejeweled
            When I walk in the room
            I can still make the whole place shimmer
            And when I meet the band
            They ask, "Do you have a man?"
            I can still say, "I don't remember"
            Familiarity breeds contempt
            Don't put me in the basement
            When I want the penthouse of your heart
            Diamonds in my eyes
            I polish up real, I polish up real nice
            Nice
            Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl (too good of a girl)
            Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve
            I think it's time to teach some lessons
            I made you my world (huh), have you heard? (Huh)
            I can reclaim the land
            And I miss you (I miss you)
            But I miss sparkling (ah, hey)
            Best believe I'm still bejeweled
            When I walk in the room
            I can still make the whole place shimmer
            And when I meet the band
            They ask, "Do you have a man?"
            I can still say, "I don't remember"
            Familiarity breeds contempt
            Don't put me in the basement
            When I want the penthouse of your heart
            Diamonds in my eyes
            I polish up real, I polish up real nice
            Nice
            Sapphire tears on my face
            Sadness became my whole sky
            But some guy said my aura's moonstone
            Just 'cause he was high
            And we're dancin' all night
            And you can try to change my mind
            But you might have to wait in line
            What's a girl gonna do?
            A diamond's gotta shine
            Best believe I'm still bejeweled
            When I walk in the room
            I can still make the whole place shimmer (shimmer)
            And when I meet the band
            They ask, "Do you have a man?"
            I can still say, "I don't remember"
            Familiarity breeds contempt
            Don't put me in the basement
            When I want the penthouse of your heart
            Diamonds in my eyes
            I polish up real (nice), I polish up real nice
            And we're dancin' all night
            And you can try to change my mind
            But you might have to wait in line
            What's a girl gonna do? What's a girl gonna do?
            I polish up nice
            Best believe I'm still bejeweled
            When I walk in the room
            I can still make the whole place shimmer
            Nice to meet you, where you been?
            I could show you incredible things
            Magic, madness, heaven, sin
            Saw you there and I thought
            "Oh, my God, look at that face
            You look like my next mistake
            Love's a game, wanna play?" Ay
            New money, suit and tie
            I can read you like a magazine
            Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
            And I know you heard about me
            So hey, let's be friends
            I'm dying to see how this one ends
            Grab your passport and my hand
            I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
            So it's gonna be forever
            Or it's gonna go down in flames
            You can tell me when it's over, mm
            If the high was worth the pain
            Got a long list of ex-lovers
            They'll tell you I'm insane
            'Cause you know I love the players
            And you love the game
            'Cause we're young, and we're reckless
            We'll take this way too far
            It'll leave you breathless, mm
            Or with a nasty scar
            Got a long list of ex-lovers
            They'll tell you I'm insane
            But I've got a blank space, baby
            And I'll write your name
            Cherry lips, crystal skies
            I could show you incredible things
            Stolen kisses, pretty lies
            You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
            Find out what you want
            Be that girl for a month
            Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
            Screaming, crying, perfect storms
            I can make all the tables turn
            Rose garden filled with thorns
            Keep you second guessing like
            "Oh, my God, who is she?"
            I get drunk on jealousy
            But you'll come back each time you leave
            'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
            So it's gonna be forever
            Or it's gonna go down in flames
            You can tell me when it's over, mm
            If the high was worth the pain
            Got a long list of ex-lovers
            They'll tell you I'm insane
            'Cause you know I love the players
            And you love the game
            'Cause we're young, and we're reckless (oh)
            We'll take this way too far
            It'll leave you breathless, mm (oh)
            Or with a nasty scar
            Got a long list of ex-lovers
            They'll tell you I'm insane (insane)
            But I've got a blank space, baby
            And I'll write your name
            Boys only want love if it's torture
            Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
            Boys only want love if it's torture
            Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
            So it's gonna be forever
            Or it's gonna go down in flames
            You can tell me when it's over (over)
            If the high was worth the pain
            Got a long list of ex-lovers
            They'll tell you I'm insane (I'm insane)
            'Cause you know I love the players
            And you love the game
            'Cause we're young, and we're reckless
            We'll take this way too far (ooh)
            It'll leave you breathless, mm
            Or with a nasty scar (leave a nasty scar)
            Got a long list of ex-lovers
            They'll tell you I'm insane
            But I've got a blank space, baby
            And I'll write your name
            You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
            She's going off about something that you said
            'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
            I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
            I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
            And she'll never know your story like I do
            But she wears short skirts
            I wear T-shirts
            She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers
            Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
            That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
            If you could see that I'm the one
            Who understands you
            Been here all along
            So, why can't you see?
            You belong with me
            You belong with me
            Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans
            I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
            Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
            Hey, isn't this easy?
            And you've got a smile
            That can light up this whole town
            I haven't seen it in a while
            Since she brought you down
            You say you're fine, I know you better than that
            Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?
            She wears high heels
            I wear sneakers
            She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers
            Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
            That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
            If you could see that I'm the one
            Who understands you
            Been here all along
            So, why can't you see?
            You belong with me
            Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
            All this time how could you not know, baby?
            You belong with me
            You belong with me
            Oh, I remember you driving to my house
            In the middle of the night
            I'm the one who makes you laugh
            When you know you're 'bout to cry
            And I know your favorite songs
            And you tell me 'bout your dreams
            Think I know where you belong
            Think I know it's with me
            Can't you see that I'm the one
            Who understands you?
            Been here all along
            So, why can't you see?
            You belong with me
            Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
            All this time how could you not know, baby?
            You belong with me
            You belong with me
            You belong with me
            Have you ever thought just maybe
            You belong with me?
            You belong with me

            Vintage tee, brand-new phone
            High heels on cobblestones
            When you are young, they assume you know nothing
            Sequin smile, black lipstick
            Sensual politics
            When you are young, they assume you know nothing

            But I knew you
            Dancin' in your Levi's
            Drunk under a streetlight, I
            I knew you
            Hand under my sweatshirt
            Baby, kiss it better, I

            And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
            Under someone's bed
            You put me on and said I was your favorite

            A friend to all is a friend to none
            Chase two girls, lose the one
            When you are young, they assume you know nothing

            But I knew you
            Playing hide-and-seek and
            Giving me your weekends, I
            I knew you
            Your heartbeat on the High Line
            Once in twenty lifetimes, I

            And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
            Under someone's bed
            You put me on and said I was your favorite

            To kiss in cars and downtown bars
            Was all we needed
            You drew stars around my scars
            But now I'm bleedin'

            'Cause I knew you
            Steppin' on the last train
            Marked me like a bloodstain, I
            I knew you
            Tried to change the ending
            Peter losing Wendy, I
            I knew you
            Leavin' like a father
            Running like water, I
            And when you are young, they assume you know nothing

            But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
            I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
            The smell of smoke would hang around this long
            'Cause I knew everything when I was young
            I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
            Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
            I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
            And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
            And I knew you'd come back to me
            You'd come back to me
            And you'd come back to me
            And you'd come back

            And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
            Under someone's bed
            You put me on and said I was your favorite

            Salt air and the rust on your door
            I never needed anything more
            Whispers of: Are you sure?
            Never have I ever before

            But I can see us lost in the memory
            August slipped away into a moment in time
            'Cause it was never mine
            And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
            August sipped away like a bottle of wine
            'Cause you were never mine

            Your back beneath the Sun
            Wishing I could write my name on it
            Will you call when you're back at school?
            I remember thinking I had you

            But I can see us lost in the memory
            August slipped away into a moment in time
            'Cause it was never mine
            And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
            August sipped away like a bottle of wine
            'Cause you were never mine

            Back when we were still changing for the better
            Wanting was enough
            For me, it was enough
            To live for the hope of it all
            Cancel plans just in case you'd call
            And say: Meet me behind the mall
            So much for summer love and saying us
            'Cause you weren't mine to lose
            You weren't mine to lose, oh

            But I can see us lost in the memory
            August slipped away into a moment in time
            'Cause it was never mine
            And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
            August sipped away like a bottle of wine
            'Cause you were never mine

            'Cause you were never mine
            Never mine
            But do you remember?

            Remember when I pulled up and said: Get in the car
            And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
            Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
            Meet me behind the mall

            (Remember when I pulled up and said: Get in the car)
            (And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?)
            (Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)
            (Meet me behind the mall)

            Remember when I pulled up and said: Get in the car
            And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
            Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (for the hope of it all)
            For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
            (For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)

            He said: Let's get out of this town
            Drive out of the city
            Away from the crowds
            I thought: Heaven can't help me now
            Nothing lasts forever
            But this is gonna take me down

            He's so tall and handsome as hell
            He's so bad, but he does it so well
            I can see the end as it begins
            My one condition is

            Say you'll remember me
            Standing in a nice dress
            Staring at the sunset, babe
            Red lips and rosy cheeks
            Say you'll see me again
            Even if it's just in your
            Wildest dreams, ah, ah, aah
            Wildest dreams, ah, ah, aah

            I said: No one has to know what we do
            His hands are in my hair
            His clothes are in the room
            And his voice is a familiar sound
            Nothing lasts forever
            But this is getting good now

            He's so tall and handsome as hell
            He's so bad, but he does it so well
            And when we've had our very last kiss
            My last request, it is

            Say you'll remember me
            Standing in a nice dress
            Staring at the sunset, babe
            Red lips and rosy cheeks
            Say you'll see me again
            Even if it's just in your
            Wildest dreams, ah, ah, aah (aah)
            Wildest dreams, ah, ah, aah

            You'll see me in hindsight
            Tangled up with you all night
            Burning it down
            Someday, when you leave me
            I bet these memories
            Follow you around

            You'll see me in hindsight
            Tangled up with you all night
            Burning it down (down)
            Someday, when you leave me
            I bet these memories
            Follow you around (follow you around)

            Say you'll remember me
            Standing in a nice dress
            Staring at the sunset, babe
            Red lips and rosy cheeks
            Say you'll see me again
            Even if it's just pretend

            Say you'll remember me
            Standing in a nice dress
            Staring at the sunset, babe
            Red lips and rosy cheeks
            Say you'll see me again
            Even if it's just in your (just pretend, just pretend)
            Wildest dreams, ah, ah, aah (aah)
            In your wildest dreams, ah, ah, aah
            Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, ah, ah, aah

            In your wildest dreams, ah, ah, aah.

            I love u Ana! I love you today and every day may live in my entire life. 
            Our love will last even if there are no more stars in the night sky, because my only star is you.
